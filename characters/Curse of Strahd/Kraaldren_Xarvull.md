# Features

Weapon Mastery
> Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longswords and Javelins.
> Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Halberds and Flails.

Extra Attack
> Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

Fighting style protection
> When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

Divine Sense (Channel Divinity)
> As a Bonus Action, you can open your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have the Incapacitated condition, you know the location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the Hallow spell.

Vow of Enmity (Channel Divinity)
> When you take the Attack action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You have Advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until you use this feature again.
> If the creature drops to 0 Hit Points before the vow ends, you can transfer the vow to a different creature within 30 feet of yourself (no action required).

Abjure Foes (Channel Divinity)
> As a Magic action, you can expend one use of this class's Channel Divinity to overwhelm foes with awe. As you present your Holy Symbol or weapon, you can target a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) that you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While Frightened in this way, a target can do only one of the following on its turns: move, take an action, or take a Bonus Action.

Aura of Protection
> Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.
> AURA:4

Aura of Courage
> You and your allies have Immunity to the Frightened condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a Frightened ally enters the aura, that condition has no effect on the ally while there.

Memories (Knowledge from a Past Life)
> You can temporarily remember glimpses of the past, perhaps faded memories from ages ago or a previous life.
> Can add [1d6] to a skill check after seeing the number on the [d20]
> Can do this a number of times equal to proficiency bonus
> Refills on long rest

Lay on Hands
> Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you finish a Long Rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to five times your Paladin level.
> As a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.
> You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing power to remove the Poisoned condition from the creature; those points don’t also restore Hit Points to the creature.

Relentless Avenger
> Your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe’s retreat. When you hit a creature with an Opportunity Attack, you can reduce the creature’s Speed to 0 until the end of the current turn. You can then move up to half your Speed as part of the same Reaction. This movement doesn’t provoke Opportunity Attacks.

# Notes

05-14-25
* Grin later died of his wounds, and from pulling the Sword of Kas out of his chest. Van Richten then revived him and returned the Sword of Kas to his chest to Grin's dismay.
* Grin, Vilnius, and Van Richten retuned to the town of Barovia, where there was celebration of Strahd's death, and sunshine
* Gladwin stayed as an incorporeal wandering soul in Barovia, a follower of Sidosun
* 400 years of time hit Kraal as he woke up in Argynvostholt, and there was another follower of Lendys, Vladamir. They expressed jealousy that they were not able to fight with Kraal, but relief that they were able to rest, and they turned to dust. 
* Kraal left Argynvostholt and miraculously met up with Grin, Vilnius, and Van Richten. Kraal asked for them to tell the other planes of the need of help in Barovia, the need for evacuation. They agreed, and Kraal continued to walk to the foggy border, where he finally rested, just beyond the fog in a small sunny spot. 
* The few survivors also crossed the border and found themselves in the gaps between other domains of dread. They continued, and found civilization among the other domains.
* Caeli traveled out of the Domains of Dread to the Shadowfell, to the Feywild, the upper planes, and ended her journey in the Elemental Plane of Air. Caeli met a prince Djinn, and Caeli regaled them with the stories of Barovia. 


05-07-25
* The group was debating how long to rest. We ultimately rested for about two hours before the castle began to shake. We couldn't wait any longer but couldn't yet fight. So Van Richten decided to sacrifice his life essence to some dark power. It gave us some health and spell slots. Not a lot, but enough to take him on.
* We found Strahd in the catacombs, praying over some altar. We attacked him.
* "You know, I was gonna ask what this invisible wall looks like, but then I realized it was invisible" - Christian
* Gladwin was killed, sent to some afterlife with his god
* Kraaldren was killed, existing in a purgatory, emerging just temporarily enough to wound Patrina and prevent her counter spell, which would have blocked Grin's casting of Impale
* Grin wounded Strahd and then pulled the sword of Kas out of his chest, striking Strahd and turning him to bloody mist
* Vilnius casted fire ball upon the mist of Strahd, destroying what little remained of him


04-16-25
* Strahd took his wife to be and walked away from the fight. We pressed on, fighting through the remainder of his forces.
* We killed the majority of his strongest allies, and destroyed the dark pulsating heart that was said to be Lendys' 


04-02-25
* We rested and prepared for the final battle, gathering potions, stealing armor from the castle, using magical abilities to heal
* We got to the tower and wiped out waves of vampire spawn. We got to the door of the tower Strahd was in, met him there, and attacked him relentlessly only for him to use a scroll of invulnerability.


03-26-25
* We cleared the antechamber of the castle.
* Strahd (stinky) showed himself, and told us we will have our final failure in the top most tower during the wedding
* We killed Lady Fiona Wachter, and Caeli whispered "stinky" in her ear as a final insult as she died


03-19-25
* We fought our way to the antechamber of the castle. 


03-12-25
* The hags attacked Berez in the night, spreading madness amongst the soldiers in the many tents around the village
* The hags were lobbing fire bombs at the tents to cause further chaos and destruction
* We lead an effort to end the soldier's madness with physical violence, then dragged them out of the burning tent we were sleeping in
* Vilnius grabbed Kraaldren's hand and used a Dimension Door to land us on one of the witches brooms
* We were able to fend off the hags, as well as the wave of brutes they summoned to siege the village


03-05-25
* Missed session
* The kids were left in Berez in safety
* The occussary we found was destroyed


02-26-25
* Having found a powerful weapon, the party decided to continue searching the abbey for loot
* We met a guy named Cloven, who had deformities in part due to the Abott, maybe maliciously caused. He was a servant, and didn't seem to care much for the Abott, but didn't want to rock the boat.
* We found out that the Abott has been intentionally withholding food from the starving people of the town, including a large number that live in the courtyard of the abbey. 
* We found a scroll of Heroes' Feast in the basement, which the party decided to use to feed the people.
* Despite them being emaciated and in violent desire for food, the magic of the spell was successfully able to create enough food for the hundred or so people that filled the courtyard.
* We came across the lab where the Abott was experimenting on, butchering, and otherwise grafting random animal limbs onto people. We destroyed the lab, the tools, and the guide book for the process. 
* We had a brief talk with the Tatyana construct. We gave her some thoughts on abandoning the Abott, fighting Strahd, and so on. She seemed to not want to harm anyone, and was at least amenable to fighting Strahd. So we let her be. 
* We found another occussary that we should destroy


2-12-25
* We fought the guards that were at the gate. It was a rough fight, but manageable. 
* We made our way up the hill to the abbey, and talked with the Abott. She played the "you're actually the evil one, I've done XYZ for the people (ignore how fearful they are for their lives)" card.
* Gladwin started poking around in an attempt to open a wall safe, and got zapped with lightning which nearly killed him
* Caeli was able to open the safe, and we found The Amulet of Ravenkind, which grants some protections from vampires


2-5-25
* We tried to rest in the werewolf cave, however we were interrupted by Tatyana. There was some kind of illusion setup to hide her true self. It was in reality a flesh golem modeled after her, named Vasilka. She told us that Strahd wants us to bring a wedding dress from Krezk to the castle for the wedding. We "agreed" and planned on burning the dress in front of Strahd.
* We left the children in the werewolf den in the hopes of returning before the magical sanctum Vilnius casted falls
* A half-man/half-bird/half-dog guy met us to deliver the package, and we gaslit him into thinking we should meet the Abbot/leader of Krezk 
* They let us inside after we gaslit them more about intending to surrender ourselves. 


1-29-25
* We decided to go with Emil to his werewolf pack to take out their corrupt leader and bring them into the fight against Strahd.
* His pack didn't take kindly to us being there, and we fought, won, and installed Emil as the new pack leader.
* He then made a speech about warring with Strahd, and spreading their gift to the nearby towns. We ought to stop that if he makes actual attempts towards that.
* They had 10 children locked in cages that the werewolves planned on eating/converting, Kraal successfully talked them out of it. There is now the problem of how to safely drop off 10 children somewhere in a domain of dread. 


1-22-25
* Gladwin held a small prayer service to celebrate all the hard work everyone has done in the face of hardship.
* Darkon has been disintegrating for about 40 years, with Azalin leaving about 3 years ago, and about 1 year ago the domain became what is almost an island chain, separated by oblivion.
* Vilnius sent a message to Mordenkainen stating "Hi I'm Vilnius, I found your book, I seek to destroy the devil, can you aid me?".
* Vilnius received the response "aAWWWWuuUWWUAAAOAOOoooaaAUAUAUoooooo"
* We talked with the war council, which were thankful for us distracting Strahd on several occasions. Though they were hungry for information. Previously they only got seconds before Strahd would regen and come after them more, but they finally had an hour or so free from direct/indirect attack from Strahd.


1-15-25
* Exethanter offered a deal: We provide 3 human followers of Strahd in exchange for a prison made for Strahd, and a guide on how to safely accept dark powers from the spirits in the Amber Temple, and Exethanter becomes ruler of Barovia
* Exethanter's chisme:
    * Dude's a lich
    * Saying "Strahd" passively allows him to scry upon us
    * Vol - Considers itself the divine blood, owner of Barovia, owner of Strahd
    * Strahd has stones buried nearby in places here and there which grant him boons
    * Ring of stones in the valley, break Strahd's boon so he loses some protections
* The party decided not to take the deal, and to instead just try to find a way to kill Strahd
* We made our way to Berez, Ismark said he was cool, apologized for being enchanted by Strahd, and gave us the Sunsword, very sus


1-8-25
* The party attacked Strahd as he left, dealing just enough damage to turn him into animate mist
* Ludmilla re-appeared after being banished, and got jumped by the party. She got turned into animate mist as well
* Vilnius casted Tenser's floating disk to help transport the body of Lyrian, however there was some text on the disk
* The text was evidently random thoughts of Tenser, with his mind loosely still on Strahd, finding a mist talisman, and getting back
* Ludmilla evidently had a tome of Mordenkainen
* King's Tear - Item that Strahd has - Could allow a dark lord to escape it's prison
* Thomas guess => The King's Tear might be able to release Strahd's master, and they want freed, but Strahd is refusing. Why else wouldn't he just use it?
* Exethanter 
    - Keeps the forgotten secrets of the Amber Temple
    - Master of Victor, Baron of Vallaki's Son, who stole spells from Exethanter


1-1-25
* The dragon used his breath weapon severely injuring many of us, then stated that he would not do this if he could
* The dragon also stated with disgust that it has a master, a devil which resides within the temple
* The dragon stated that we must best it, and destroy it's heart
* The dragon almost intentionally let us kill it, bowing it's head and easing into the restraints of Vilnius' elemental. We killed it.
* The dragon had carvings upon it's bone, inscriptions of binding and necromancy
* We created a tiny hut, and rested inside

* At the Temple, Strahd met with the party. Insults and arguing was thrown around, and Lyrian was presented to the party as a vampire spawn, ravenous and hungry for our blood.
* Grin obliterated Lyrian with a quick finger of death, turning him into a pool of viscera and bloody snow.
* The ensuing battle lead to the death of Kraal, and several falls followed by rises of Gladwin.
* Strahd became bored, and walked away.


12-4-24
* We briefly mourned Kraal and Lyrian, before Vilnius rejoined the party after cowering in the upstairs amphitheater
* We tried to leave the temple as soon as we could, but got into a brief interaction with [Didn't catch name]
* As we descended the snowy mountain, a figure in the distance was seen walking towards them. It was Kraal, in the body of a previous follower of Lendys
* Gladwin had a brief pep talk with his armor 
* We asked Kraaldren about his death experience, why he is in a new body, and what it felt like
* Gladwin tried to proselytize Vilnius to
* We then made our way back up the mountain to the temple
* As the party approached the last few hundred feet to the temple, the dragon from earlier slithered out of the snow


11-13-24
* Strahd threatened to finish off the party if Lyrian did not cooperate. Lyrian complied with Strahd's wishes, and placed Lyrian upon one of the sarcophagi
* A voice told Lyrian that it would not release it's champion, Strahd, and to tell Strahd as much.
* Lyrian did not embrace the power of the voice in the sarcophagus, after being offered to become a vampire, with legions to defeat Strahd, to replace Strahd, at the price of killing Grin.
* Caeli was similarly offered power and aid by a unsourced voice, though it did not come with a request for payment. It helped Caeli.
* Gladwin was also offered power. 
* Grin felt drawn to some foreign and far source, but otherwise felt like he was in a raw state of inertia of nothing. "You owe me something" a voice said to him. It then threatened Grin to will themselves back to life, so that Grin can return the sword of Kas embedded in his chest.
* Kraal was simply a mound of dust.


11-06-24
* We lost.
* We lost, but not for a lack of trying. Every single one of the members of the party gave everything they could. Gladwin slammed the room with several instances of daylight. Lyrian pressing Strahd's buttons with blink and the sunblade. Kraaldren with 3 deaths in a row. Caeli with a bit of everything. And Grin with an incredible use of banishment and finger of death.


10-30-24
* As we rested, we heard something bumping around outside.
* Alana was later found outside the room we were in, chained by the neck with a sword through her chest. On the sword was tied a note.
* The note was a "last chance" type note from Strahd
* We explored further into the temple, and discovered a sunblade inside the central statue.
* We opened up a room, and an amber golem attacked us for it. After killing it we looted a ton of gold and nick nack treasures
* Pressing on, we discovered a grand and central room with Strahd sitting on a throne with one of his wives
* Grin banished the wife, which started yet another fight between Strahd and the party


10-23-24
* After finishing exploring the left lower side of the temple, we left for the center room, where we were ambushed by the 40ft tall statue in the room, shrouded in darkness at the face
* Turns out it was a man inside the statue allegedly called Heinrick 
* "Heinrick" ran off into the hole on the second floor, Kraal followed only to discover 3 flameskulls at the bottom. Kraal immediately returned, and the flame skulls followed, casting 3 fireballs all at once on 3 members of the party. 
* Through some strong moonbeam action from Gladwin, the flameskulls were killed, and the downed party members were revived
* The hole was sealed with a nearby door pulled off it's hinges, and we short rested inside one of the secret rooms
* We realized we had a bag with the remains of a few flameskulls that would reform. Some arguing over what to do with it happened, to which Kraal responded by grabbing it and leaving the temple to dispose of it.
* A dragon was waiting outside, it said "Night" in draconic, and instantly downed Kraaldren. The group heard the commotion, and peaked outside to see what happened.
* The dragon attacked Lyrian and Grin. They ran off to get Gladwin and tell him Kraal was downed. 
* Gladwin saw the dragon, who told him "I would not harm you if I could, go, rise my champion", and then swiped at Gladwin as he resurrected Kraaldren.
* The party rested.


10-16-24
* We explored the lower floor of the temple, only to discover some strange looking, ugly eye creatures speaking undercommon
* They tried to extract information out of Grin through magical means, this started a fight which they promptly lost
* Some dead guys in some coffins offered us shady powers, but none of us took up the offer
* One of the coffins seems to have known Grin, saying that someone named Azalin was said to have left Barovia/the domains of dread by one of the coffins 
* The coffin that knows Grin wants Strahd dead, the sword of Kas returned, and for Grin to meet them


10-09-24
* We all escaped from the cloud, and regrouped on the left side room.
* Kraal was evidently still dead despite walking, moving, and talking. He had a moment of panic, that quickly ended when Gladwin used his amulet to resurrect him. That gave Kraal a moment of energy, which he promptly used to haphazardly rush into the next room.
* Inside were 3 flame skulls, which were quickly dispatched by the party. 
* Grin warned Kraal to be more careful, or it could wind up with him dead again, and Kraal snapped at him over it, before relenting, then slumping over into a corner
* We acquired the items from the dead wizard, who was a member of Osybus (An order of necromancers who worship dark lords)


10-02-24
* A stone golem was in the temple's halls and attacked us. We had some initial troubles, but quickly discovered a significant number of its immunities. We quickly turned it into a Pittsburgh side walk.
* A man by the name of Vilnius was found in the temple cowering with a V shaped amulet. He said his master Jari-karian likely died somewhere in the temple, probably burnt to death by skulls. They were here in search of knowledge, and were planning to directly return to Faerun.
* We left Vilnius and went to the other side of the temple, to discover a dozen or so mountain men.
* As it turns out, Strahd was among that group, and the group was his allied druids. He quickly slaughtered Kraal, and began working on the rest of the party.
* Some entity or force brought Kraaldren back to some sort of state of life. It was welcomed by Kraal easily, and used to lash against Strahd with fervor.
* Strahd casted cloud kill, and escaped into some corner of the temple.


09-25-24
* Strahd was immediately attacked by Kraaldren, but after a brief back and forth, and a plea from Gladwin to stop, Kraal and Strahd ceased
* We started trekking up the mountain to the Amber Temple. Strahd quickly became impatient, and teleported Gladwin and Grin to the top, and gave the rest of us flight
* Gladwin had some time to himself on top of the mountain, and used it to talk to some kind of entity (by the name of Sidosun) who was on top of a nearby peak shrouded in purple light. This stranger said they were probably the sister of someone by the name of Siluna. They said that the realm was like a prison, actively being enforced by another entity, but it is breakable with a ritual. There is a ring of stones that is relevant to this.
* Strahd threatened to kill Gladwin for talking with the entity.
* When we got to the Amber Temple, Strahd was unable to enter. He pressured Lyrian and tried to cast spell to get Lyrian to give Strahd permission to enter, but this was avoided with a quick casting of Protection from Evil from Gladwin
* We then started to explore the Amber Temple, finding occasional loot, with lots and lots of dust, decay, and malevolent air


09-11-24
* Strahd left us on the cold wind blown bridge, in the ice and snow. When we awoke, Strahd and his forces were nowhere to be seen.
* The group then spent some time patching each other up, re-attaching limbs, and so on.
* Just barely alive, we took shelter in the tower near the bridge.
* It was discovered Strahd took his tome back, so the group is once more trapped in Barovia
* Strahd once more showed up, having used the teleportation circle in the tower


09-04-24
* The Battle of the Tsolenka bridge went terrible. All party members were either captured or killed by Strahd and his forces. Kraal was decapitated after dealing a massive set of futile attacks against Strahd


08-28-24
* We solved the vrock puzzle
* We explored the tower within the passage keep
* We met the end of the road. Strahd caught us with Tenser, and decided to attack us at the bridge to the mountain pass.
* We still need to talk to Tenser about night hags 


08-21-24
* We arrived in Berez, and we were warmly greeted with spears and door closings. We had to explain that Kraal wasn't an agent of Strahd.
* We then entered Poppie's shop. She wouldn't stop trying to sell us stilts. But we bought lots of winter gear, and some weapons.
* We were permitted use of **P**oppie's **P**ainting **P**ortal as **p**assage to the **p**ond known as Luna lake.
* We traveled to the keep that guarded the bridge and path to the Amber temple, but we were ambushed by gargoyle demon bird things as we approached.


08-14-24
* We solved the caler-ado puzzle
* Told to stay away from Arg-an-vast-hold because it will give Kraaldren the big sad (apathy/soul loss/etc as I join my followers of Lendys)
* We traveled to Tenser's crumbly old tower after a long conversation about what gift to give him as a show of good will
* Tenser and his group didn't take kindly to how we treated him at the castle
* Tenser came around to working together. He and his team agreed to come with us to The Amber Temple to find a weapon to kill Strahd.
* Gladwin got a very normal suit of armor


07-24-24
* Got kicked out of military camp because they saw us as bringing trouble because of the hag situation
* Went to Vallaki
* Met up with Rictavio, who turned out to be hiding a lot of things, namely:
    * Is the father of Kali
    * Wanted to send us all back to Faerun (esp Kali)
    * Wants to kill Strahd
    * Told us that the next clue to potentially killing Strahd would be in the tomb/temple Strahd wanted us to check out
    * The Amber Temple on Mount Ghakis (We should be like level 9)
    * Read a bedtime story about Strahd's origins from Strahd's book
* Further revealed stuff about Kraaldren's undead nature (urn, urn travel, etc)
