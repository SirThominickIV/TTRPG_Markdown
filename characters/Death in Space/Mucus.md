# Bio
## Mucus
This blue and green tinted ooze slimed itself into a crate as a stowaway one day. The crew decided to keep it after it demonstrated some mild qualities of sentience. It slowly began holding onto scrap electronics, incorporating them into it's body. Maybe it is botched coolant liquid, maybe it is the spawn of some void creature. Either way it stole a voice modulator from an occultist and is using that to speak now. Mucus has 3 Metal fragments lose within its protoplasm

**Trait**: Polite
**Drive**: Free Will, defense of Mucus' home planet
**Backstory**: Mucus' allegiance is to its home planet, which was annexed by several corporations during the war.

# Features

## Origin
**Goop.** Ancient AI placed in a body vessel of organic material. Part machine, but with an organic CPU and a distributed neural system that requires oxygen.
* Native Machine. You can converse with computers as if they were real people. Plug in and find a friend.
* Engineered Respiration. Use half oxygen compared to everyone else (one step for every two normal steps).

## Background
**Asteroid Driller.** Mucus found itself uniquely suited for the needs of drilling in asteroids. It has no true concept of up, as all parts of it's body are homogeneous and identical. This was advantageous, and helped keep Mucus as a member of the crew.
**Stubborn.** Never give up. Reroll any dice roll once per session.

# Notes

04-17-25
* We got the water started for Roy, who started work on the ship. He said he'd pay us for some information on non phys (how many addicts per level, get as many samples of strains as possible, 100 per head brought to Roy)
* We started talking to addicts to try to get some samples, and got two
* Roy started work on the ship, he will finish 15m after the next shuttle
* We have 2 hours left until the next shuttle

Addict count:
    Common Area: 4 (dumpster), 2 (passed out at bar, may be alchol), 1 dealer by the beds (green humanish guy)
    Docks: 1 guy at selling "cleaning oil"

Non phys types:
* Hola! 
* OQ-Type - Visor for better images & experience

* Mucus talked to the bartender on the docking level of the Iron Ring, and now the bartender has a grudge
* We talked to Hina, who said she'd be able to fuel our ship in exchange for safe travel. She told us there is a hitman on the docking ring that might be able to clear the trash
* The hitman guy was a blue hued alien, who said they'd give us 50 holos to kill some guy from the Materia cult. Frankel would be best, but any one of them will do. 
* Roy said he'd help with the trash and the ship repairs so long as we fix the water situation
* A guard blocked our way to the areas needed to fix the water, he was reading a union pamphlet labled "AURAM 80 Unite!". We bribed him by saying we approved of unions.
* Mucus was able to sneak into a hatch and start messing with the machines inside the crawlspace of the station, which provided sufficient distraction for the crew to sneak into Monotone's room
* We broke into Monotone's room and discovered that he had pictures with Hina and Roy from before the war. Astra (Timmy) was able to correctly guess the password with no hints on second try (the module straight up said the password and Timmy guessed correct)
* Mucus stole some cables from the crawl space, which caused an alarm, locking the crew in Monotone's room. The door opened and Monotone was there. Astra changed his face using his tech mask to look like one of the guards. This fooled him and the crew was able to leave.

Known Gangs
* Pasel
    - Run by Roy
    - Engine room
    - Controls output power of station
* Parliament
    - Run by Monotone
    - Computer center
    - Control computer systems, air, water

Rumors
* A farmer in the engine room is aggravated that the water got cut off
* There may be some sort of back door to the main computer systems on the station, but it's on the outside of the station in space
* Hina can help with fuel
* Roy & Monotone could give us fuel/repairs within 3 hours
* Something bad is about to happen on the station in 4 hours
